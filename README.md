# Introduction 
Using the games international translation files for the Japanese version of the game would give you a lot a missing translations, but no more!
Now I got international translations ready for you to use in the Japanese version. The translations of both current builds, JTOS and ITOS, got programmatically mapped by comparing their Korean translations.

# Installation
Move the language folder (e.g. `English`) in the games `languageData` folder.

Your games folder path should then look something like this:
```
../Steam/steamapps/common/Tree of Savior (Japanese Ver.)/release/languageData/English
```
That's it, you're ready to go!

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Translations cause display issues with some Japanese characters. What can I do?
This might be caused due to the game being launched with the wrong localization. The Japanese version of the game should always be launched with Japanaese localization, either by setting it in your OS or using a tool *(e.g. Locale Emulator)* to execute the application in said localization.

## Some texts are not translated or display just what seems to be an ID, why?
Due to the translations being mapped programmatically they will not be free of error and any hint towards missing or faulty translations is always appreciacted!
